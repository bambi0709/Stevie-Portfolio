# Hi, I'm Stevie 👋

Welcome to my long-term coding, AI and engineering portfolio.  
I’m documenting everything I learn from Year 7 all the way through to sixth form, as I work towards a future in technology.

I’m especially interested in:
- Gaming and game mechanics 🎮  
- Cars and automotive engineering 🚗  
- Football statistics and sports analytics ⚽  
- Music and technology 🎵  
- Computers, AI tools and coding 💻  

This portfolio includes the projects I build as I learn:
- Python programming  
- Problem-solving and algorithms  
- Data handling and visualisation  
- AI and machine learning  
- Web development  
- Maths for computing and engineering  

I created this portfolio to develop real technical skills and to show my progress over time.  
My long-term goal is to build a strong foundation for future opportunities, including:

## 🎓 University Degrees  
I may choose to study Computer Science, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Robotics or Cyber Security at university.

## 💼 Degree Apprenticeships  
I’m also working towards being competitive for high-level tech apprenticeships with companies such as:
- Dyson  
- GCHQ  
- AstraZeneca  
- Jaguar Land Rover  
- BBC  
- IBM  
- Google  
- Microsoft  
- PwC  
- KPMG  

These pathways allow me to work in the tech industry while earning a degree at the same time.

## 🧪 STEM Competitions & Opportunities  
Throughout my school years I plan to take part in:
- Coding competitions  
- Maths challenges  
- Robotics and engineering events  
- AI and data science contests  
- Creative computing challenges  

These opportunities will help me develop confidence, teamwork skills, and real-world technical experience.

# 🚀 My Goal

My aim is to become a confident young engineer with a portfolio full of real projects that show:
- Curiosity  
- Creativity  
- Independent learning  
- Technical skill  
- Problem-solving ability  

I will continue updating this portfolio as I build more advanced projects each year.

Thanks for visiting!
